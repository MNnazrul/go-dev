# Go Backend Development Roadmap

Since you've already learned the **basics of Go**, hereâ€™s a structured roadmap for mastering **backend development** with Go:

## **1. Web Development & APIs**

- Learn `net/http` package for handling HTTP requests.
- Explore Web frameworks: **Gin**, **Echo**, **Fiber**.
- Middleware implementation (logging, authentication, error handling).
- Structuring RESTful APIs (best practices, versioning, pagination).
- Building GraphQL APIs using **gqlgen**.

## **2. Database & ORM**

- Understanding SQL basics (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
- Working with ORM libraries: **GORM** (for relational databases).
- Using NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Redis.
- Database transactions and migrations.
- Optimizing database queries and indexing strategies.

## **3. Authentication & Authorization**

- Implementing JWT-based authentication.
- OAuth2 authentication flow.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for user permissions.
- Session management techniques.
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt.

## **4. Concurrency & Parallelism**

- Understanding Goroutines and how they work.
- Using channels for communication between Goroutines.
- Implementing worker pools for parallel processing.
- Handling race conditions with Mutexes & WaitGroups.
- Context package for handling request timeouts.

## **5. Microservices & Communication**

- Designing scalable microservices architecture.
- Understanding **gRPC** vs. REST APIs.
- Using Protocol Buffers (`protobuf`) for efficient communication.
- Service discovery and load balancing techniques.
- Implementing message queues with Kafka, RabbitMQ.
- API Gateway integration for managing multiple microservices.

## **6. Caching & Performance Optimization**

- Implementing caching strategies using **Redis**.
- Optimizing database queries to reduce load.
- Using in-memory caching to speed up API responses.
- Rate limiting and request throttling to handle high traffic.
- Performance profiling and benchmarking with **pprof**.

## **7. Testing & Debugging**

- Writing unit tests using the `testing` package.
- Creating integration tests to validate API functionality.
- Mocking database and external dependencies in tests.
- Using **table-driven tests** for better test coverage.
- Debugging Go applications using **Delve** debugger.
- Implementing logging with **Zap** or **Logrus**.

## **8. Deployment & DevOps**

- Containerizing Go applications with **Docker**.
- Managing deployment with Kubernetes (`k8s`).
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
- Configuring logging & monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana.
- Load balancing with Nginx or Traefik.
- Environment variable management and configuration secrets.

## **9. Security Best Practices**

- Protecting APIs with CORS and CSRF prevention.
- Preventing SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Securely handling environment variables with `.env` files.
- Using HTTPS & TLS encryption for secure communication.
- Implementing security headers for added protection.

## **10. Advanced Topics**

- WebSockets for real-time applications (chat, notifications).
- Implementing an event-driven architecture using Go.
- Serverless applications with AWS Lambda and Go.
- Writing CLI tools and automation scripts in Go.
- Implementing GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates.
